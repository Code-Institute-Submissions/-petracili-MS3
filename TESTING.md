## Validator Testing
### **HTML**

 I checked all of the HTML pages using [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)

 I check from the live site by right clicking each page, selecting View Page Source and running that generated code through the validator.

 All pages passed all checks. 


### **CSS**

I checked the CSS file using [W3C CSS Markup Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)


All pages passed all checks.

### **JavaScript**

I checked the script.js file using [JSHint](https://jshint.com/).

Same as on HTML Validation I have to chenck each js file. 

Only what coming is a few waring.
