## Validator Testing
### **HTML**

 I checked all of the HTML pages using [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)

 I check from the live site by right clicking each page, selecting View Page Source and running that generated code through the validator.

 All pages passed all checks.
