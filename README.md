> Contact Page have form for send email.

---------------------------

#### **Colors scheme and typography**

 I have used the Noto Sans from Google Fonts. I have chosen the Noto Sans because it's handwriting calligraphy style for the title. Every other visible text is using Noto Sans.

 The site heavily relies on imagery so I wanted to find a balance between colors. I chose a light pink and white that is soothing and encourages creativity, which I think is a great choice for a page that focuses on a peopel's best friends.
